/**
 * Why are we disabling rules-of-hooks here?
 *
 * Well, we are using several hooks in this class, which is not allowed by this rule.
 * However, we are not using these hooks in a component, but in a utility class.
 * The important thing to remember is that these functions must be called on every render,
 * unconditionally (i.e. not in a conditional statement) and not in a loop.
 * This is exactly what we are doing here. We are only using the class to group the functions together
 * and give additional context to the functions.
